# sUASData
Best sUAS Data and Metadata Community Practices 


This repository was started out of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) sUAS Data Interest Group meeting in 2017.  Our group page is [here](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/small-unmanned-aircraft-systems%E2%80%99-data-ig) with an open mailing list if you would like to engage with the broader community.

The goal of this [wiki](https://github.com/RDA-sUAS-Data-IG/sUASData/wiki) is to enable community conversation (in github [issues](https://github.com/RDA-sUAS-Data-IG/sUASData/issues)) and provide a space for documentation development around what best practices we want to foster when capturing data using sUAS.  Iff,  the community moves forward with this and at a later date we wish to pursue it, the Research Data Alliance affords a convenient means of formal expert review and officiation that fundng agencies recognise.
